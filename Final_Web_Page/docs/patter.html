 <p style="text-align:justify">
 The course intends to familiarize the students with Pattern Recognition Systems, known methodologies and applications of the field.
 Moreover, it demonstrates how those systems are designed, developed and evaluated. On a second level, 
 the student is asked to design and develop their own Pattern Recognition System for specific patterns or application.</p>
