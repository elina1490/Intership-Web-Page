	<p style="text-align:justify"> The 1st Summer School on Document Image Processing provided both, an objective overview and an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art 
   of the research field and its current open issues. The courses were delivered by world-renowned researchers in the field, covering both 
   theoretical and practical aspects of real problems of Document Image Processing, as well as examples of successful applications.
	A 5-day workshop  offered the opportunity to young researchers and PhD students  to explore their knowledge in Image Processing and Document 
	Image Processing from basic to advanced level.  </p>
