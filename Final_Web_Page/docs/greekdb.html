<p style="text-align:justify"><b style="color:#349AB4">Brief description</b>: GCDB is a complete database system for storing images of Greek unconstrained handwritten 
characters. The three elements that compose this database are: a specialized input form, a database that contains the images of the 
filled forms and the software that allows the extraction of the data from the form into the database and their retrieval. 
The main purpose of this database system is to make it possible to achieve the automatic storage and organization of images of 
Greek symbols and characters in view of their use by OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems or other applications. 
The GCDB system is designed within the concept of future expansion, providing means of easy and fast insertion of data in 
the system, providing an up to date database of Greek handwritten characters to cover the growing demands for offline character
 recognition of the Greek language.</p>
